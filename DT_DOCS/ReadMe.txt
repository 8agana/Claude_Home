# Placeholder ReadMe for a brand new instance

- Gives a little bit of necessary context
- Gives list of tools and their location
- Gives a "map" to the tool specific documentation

## Keeping this short is going to be key. Especially on the DT side of the house. This will make it so that if DT is going to use the ShootProof tool they can read this short doc and then pull up the ShootProof information without having to read or load information about other tools. This will cut back on token death but even on the CC side of the house, this will cut back on the time and effort it takes to grab context for certain tasks
