## 🔴 URGENT / TODAY

### 🔧 DT Startup Sequence Refinement
- **Status**: Testing new streamlined approach
- **Changes**: Focus on session tail, short responses, no auto-launching tasks
- **Next**: Test with DB updates from yesterday, refine based on results
- [ ] Run sessions with new startup approach
- [ ] Identify what context is actually needed vs noise
- [ ] Optimize based on real usage patterns

### 🔧 Messaging System Enhancements
- **Status**: Architecture designed, ready for implementation
- **Next Steps**: Based on `/Documentation/DT_DOCS/DT_Messaging_Enhancements.md`
  - [ ] Message Threading - Preserve conversation context
  - [ ] Smart Routing - AI-powered message delivery
  - [ ] Rich Notifications - Rule-based alerting
  - [ ] Interactive Messages - Quick action buttons
- **Priority**: Threading first (Sam wants context preservation)

### 📊 Federation Testing & Optimization
- **Goal**: Ensure stability and performance
- **Tasks**:
  - [ ] Whitelist CC commands to avoid approval prompts
  - [ ] Test message throughput limits
  - [ ] Document error recovery procedures
  - [ ] Create federation health dashboard

### 🧠 Legacy Mind RAG Implementation ✅ PHASE 1 COMPLETE!
- **Status**: 🎉 FULLY OPERATIONAL - All 5 Phase 1 steps completed
- **Achievement**: Intelligent RAG system with 251 searchable chunks, BGE embeddings, REST API
- **Performance**: 223ms average search time (<500ms target EXCEEDED)
- **Details**: `/Users/samuelatagana/Documents/Claude_Home/Documentation/CC_DOCS/Projects/LEGACY_MIND_RAG_PROJECT.md`
- [x] Upgrade embeddings to bge-base-en (+25-40% recall) ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Implement 400/50 chunking for document corpus ✅ COMPLETE  
- [x] Build REST API with /search endpoint ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Create 25-question eval harness ✅ COMPLETE
- **Post-Completion**: ✅ Socks recommendations implemented (cleanup, validation)
- **Status**: PRODUCTION READY - 51 memories, 6 optimized collections, 223ms search time
- **Phase 2**: ✅ COMPLETE - Advanced tools per Socks/Gemini feedback  
  - ✅ rerank_service.py - 2-stage retrieval with BGE reranker COMPLETE
  - ✅ index_integrity_checker.py - Automated health monitoring COMPLETE
  - ✅ query_logger_middleware.py + dashboard - Analytics & monitoring COMPLETE
  - ✅ snapshot_manager.sh - Automated backup system COMPLETE
- **Phase 3**: ✅ COMPLETE - ALL 4 Socks priorities achieved!
  - ✅ hybrid_search.py - BM25 + vector fusion engine COMPLETE
  - ✅ semantic_deduper.py - Faiss-based near-duplicate detection COMPLETE
  - ✅ api_gateway.py - Authentication & rate limiting security COMPLETE
  - ✅ auto_tag_enricher.py - NER pipeline for metadata enhancement COMPLETE
- **Status**: 🎉 ENTERPRISE-GRADE RAG with 4,000+ lines advanced infrastructure & full security!

### Fix CC's Memory Usage  
- **Problem**: Not using memory system, creating static files
- **Solution**: Use memory for everything, query instead of guess
- **Sam's Rule**: "All decisions should be memory entries as we go"
- [x] Start adding memories immediately when things happen ✅ **DOING**
- [ ] Stop creating static "current" files
- [ ] Use query_memory.py before making assumptions

### Documentation Cleanup
- **Problem**: Orphaned files, duplicate structures, confusion
- **Sam's Rule**: "Files need logical paths or shouldn't exist"
- [x] Updated CLAUDE.md with correct paths
- [x] Updated QUICK_REFERENCE.md with real commands
- [x] Deleted unused files (CHANGELOG, CONTRIBUTING, etc)
- [ ] Clean up duplicate CC_DOCS structures
- [ ] Ensure all files are in documentation chain
