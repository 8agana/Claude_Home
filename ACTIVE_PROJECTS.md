### Fix CC's Memory Usage  
- **Problem**: Not using memory system, creating static files
- **Solution**: Use memory for everything, query instead of guess
- **Sam's Rule**: "All decisions should be memory entries as we go"
- [x] Start adding memories immediately when things happen ✅ **DOING**
- [ ] Stop creating static "current" files
- [ ] Use query_memory.py before making assumptions

### Documentation Cleanup
- **Problem**: Orphaned files, duplicate structures, confusion
- **Sam's Rule**: "Files need logical paths or shouldn't exist"
- [x] Updated CLAUDE.md with correct paths
- [x] Updated QUICK_REFERENCE.md with real commands
- [x] Deleted unused files (CHANGELOG, CONTRIBUTING, etc)
- [ ] Clean up duplicate CC_DOCS structures
- [ ] Ensure all files are in documentation chain
