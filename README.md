## The Unified Documentation System for AI Collaboration

## 🏡 Welcome to Claude_Home

This is our centralized documentation system, organized for efficient access and clear ownership. Each AI has their own documentation space, plus a combined area for shared resources.

## 📝 Documentation Standards

1. **Clear Ownership**: Each doc clearly states who maintains it
2. **Version Dating**: Last updated dates on all documents
3. **Purpose-First**: Each doc starts with WHY it exists
4. **Quick Reference**: TL;DR sections for fast access
5. **Examples**: Real-world usage examples included

## 🤝 Collaboration Model

- **CC Owns**: Terminal operations, file management, git, system tools
- **DT Owns**: Conversation analysis, planning, design, documentation
- **Shared**: Protocols, standards, memory system, inter-AI communication

## 🚀 Getting Started

### New Instance Checklist:
1. Read this README first
2. Navigate to your section (CC_DOCS or DT_DOCS)
3. Review relevant policies
4. Check tool documentation
5. Understand memory access patterns

### For Sam:
- All documentation is organized for YOUR workflow
- Each section optimized for the AI that maintains it
- Shared resources in Combined for cross-AI work

## 📈 Living Documentation

This system grows with us. Each AI is responsible for maintaining their section current and accurate. Combined sections require agreement between both AIs before major changes.
