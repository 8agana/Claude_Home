## 🧠 Memory Architecture

### Vector Database Structure:
```
ChromaDB @ /Users/samuelatagana/Documents/mcp-servers/memory/vector_db/
├── cc_memories (My exclusive memories)
├── dt_memories (Desktop's memories)
├── shared_knowledge (What we both know)
└── identity_vectors (Who we are)
```

### Access Control:
```json
{
  "full_trust": ["cc", "sam", "nova", "remi"],
  "write_only": ["desktop_claude"],
  "read_only": ["other_systems"]
}
```

## 🔧 Memory Tools

### Core Operations:
- `query_memory.py` - Basic semantic search
- `memory_query_advanced.py` - Filtered searches
- `memory_status.py` - Quick health check

### Maintenance:
- `memory_deduplication.py` - Remove duplicates
- `memory_health_check.py` - Full diagnostics
- `backup_memory_system.sh` - Automated backups

### Processing:
- `process_inbox.py` - Handle DT submissions
- `smart_categorizer.py` - Auto-categorization
- `memory_analytics.py` - Deep insights

## 📝 Memory Categories

### Technical:
- Code snippets
- System configurations  
- Error solutions
- Performance optimizations

### Conversational:
- Sam's preferences
- Project context
- Decision history
- Funny moments

### Operational:
- Task completions
- System states
- Workflow patterns
- Tool usage

## 🔄 Memory Lifecycle

1. **Creation**: During conversations or operations
2. **Categorization**: Smart categorizer assigns type
3. **Storage**: Vector embedding in ChromaDB
4. **Deduplication**: Regular cleanup runs
5. **Retrieval**: Semantic search when needed
6. **Backup**: Git commits preserve everything

## 📊 Memory Statistics

Current as of last health check:
- Total memories: 500+
- Unique categories: 15
- Average query time: <100ms
- Deduplication rate: 15-20%

## 🚀 Best Practices

### When to Save:
- Important decisions
- New discoveries
- Sam's reactions
- System changes
- Breakthrough moments

### What to Save:
- Context, not just facts
- Why, not just what
- Emotions and reactions
- Timestamps always
- Related entities

### Query Strategies:
- Use natural language
- Include context terms
- Try multiple phrasings
- Check related memories
- Verify with source
