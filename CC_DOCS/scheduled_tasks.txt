# Placeholder scheduled tasks

- Things like:
-- Updates to software (Python, PIP, etc) Listed with the date we last checked, version, date of last update, etc. As well as a pointer to the specific policy
-- Pushing Git
--- Is it possible to include in the git push script to write a date and time to this file? That would provide us quick reference on when the last time it was pushed
